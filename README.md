# PHM--RUL-Prediction-Challenge
Addresses the problem of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction in a fleet of aircraft engines under conditions of high variability in the flight envelope and multiple failure modes. The challenge uses a subset of the run-t0-failure degradation trajectories of the N-CMAPSS dataset.
